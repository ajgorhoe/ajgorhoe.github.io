These tools were initially created in the following location:

* GitHub private repository [ajgorhoe/web.arnes.ljc3m2/, directory test/AutoRedirect/](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/web.arnes.ljc3m2/tree/main/test/AutoRedirect)
* Web: [https://www2.arnes.si/~ljc3m2/test/AutoRedirect/](https://www2.arnes.si/~ljc3m2/test/AutoRedirect/)

More information about the rationale for these scripts is provided in the following [this private wiki](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/wiki.IGLib/blob/main/web/Wiki_Web.md#submitting-web-sites-to-search-engines).
